# Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Programs

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a collection of **Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** examples designed to demonstrate core OOP concepts such as **inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation, class methods, static methods, and operator overloading**.

These programs are ideal for **students, beginners, and interview preparation**.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

* Classes & Objects
* Inheritance (Single & Multi-level)
* Method Overriding
* Polymorphism (Compile-time & Runtime)
* Encapsulation (Private Attributes)
* Abstraction (Abstract Base Classes)
* Class Methods & Static Methods
* Operator Overloading
* Magic Methods (`__str__`, `__add__`)
